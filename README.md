## **ðŸ“š Workshop Overview**

Welcome to the **GirlGeek25 Docker Workshop**!

This repository provides a complete hands-on learning experience with **Docker and containerization**, guiding participants from **fundamental exercises** to a **takeaway assignment**.

The workshop is designed to help you:

* Understand **containerization and virtualization concepts**
* Build, run, and deploy Docker containers
* Work with **Dockerfiles, environment variables, ports, and volumes**
* Gain confidence with **real-world Docker workflows**

## **ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure**

```
handson/                 # Guided exercises for Docker beginners
takeawayassignment/      # Independent assignment for hands-on practice
```

> Each folder contains its own detailed README explaining setup, instructions, and expected outcomes.

**Brief Overview:**

* **handson/** â€“ Starter Flask web app for guided exercises. Students will learn Docker basics including building images, running containers, and modifying code inside containers.
* **takeawayassignment/** â€“ Independent assignment where students build a Dockerized Python API (Quotes & Jokes), write a robust Dockerfile, and deploy it locally and on Docker Hub.
